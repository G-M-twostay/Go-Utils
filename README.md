# Go-Utils
Go
Some utilities I implemented myself for future uses in Go. Usually these are some data structures or algorithms that Go STL doesn't provide or I can't find a satisfying implementation of. Currently, Concurrent Maps are in a good state. Tress can be speed up by not using interfaces. Atomic primitives are just some convenient types to ensure compatibility in edge cases for 32bit machines.
