# Go-Utils

Go
Some utilities I implemented myself for future uses in Go. Usually these are some data structures or algorithms that Go
STL doesn't provide or I can't find a satisfying implementation of. 

Package `GMUtils/Maps` includes some very-fast thread-safe concurrent hashmap implementations. Package `GMUtils/Tress` include a balanced BST implementation called SBTree. Package `GMUtils/Queues` includes a circular array queue and a concurrent non-blocking linked queue.
